She was a witch! A Polish witch. The sickle was placed at her throat to keep her from coming back from the dead, apparently after the padlock on her foot failed to do the job. Her grave was found in an unmarked cemetery in the village of Pień, which is approximately 133 miles (214km) south of Warsaw and 60 miles (96km) ENE of Kraków.
